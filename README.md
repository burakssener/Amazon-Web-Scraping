# **Amazon Discount Tracker**

## **Overview**
This project automates the process of tracking your favorite Amazon products for discounts. It constantly monitors product prices and sends you an email notification whenever there is a price drop. The implementation leverages web scraping and automation techniques using Python.

## **Features**
- Scrapes Amazon product pages to fetch:
  - Product Name
  - Current Price
  - Product Availability
- Tracks prices over time for selected products.
- Sends email alerts when a price drop is detected.
